# Geofence Tracking
Geofence tracking is an Android project made with jetpack compose. This project uses Android's Geofence API to get notify users when they enter/exit the geofence. It also calculates the duration of the user's stay in that particular geofence area and records the time of entry and exit.

# Demo

Entered in Geofence        |  Exit from Geofence
